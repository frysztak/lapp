Simple, Dropbox-synchronised note editor.

Notes are saved as Markdown files to Dropbox, which allows them to be easily editable with any text editor. Synchronization works two-ways:

- changes made inside the editor are saved and uploaded as soon as you stop typing
- changes made on Dropbox folder (e.g. when editing the file locally and synchronising using Dropbox client) are detected and downloaded
